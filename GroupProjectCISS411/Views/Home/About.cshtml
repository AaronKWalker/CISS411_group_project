<body>
    <p>The Smith Swimming School (3S) is a family owned business that teaches children and adults how to swim. It started about 30 years ago when Grandpa Smith retired from Tiny University as a swimming coach and wanted to continue coaching. Today all full time employees are Smiths or in-laws.</p>
